I am Mohsen Kardani, a self-taught programmer who is deeply interested in web development. In the last two years, I have started learning to code and have reached a moderate level of proficiency. My journey into the fascinating realm of web design led me to expand my expertise to HTML and CSS and delve into the details of designing visually appealing and functional websites.

With a strong desire to expand my skill set, I took on the challenge of mastering JavaScript and skillfully combined tools like Tailwind and React to enhance my development capabilities. With a thorough understanding of the JavaScript language, I am well equipped to navigate the complexities of modern web development.

In my quest for a holistic learning experience, I actively participated in several web design bootcamps, where I not only fine-tuned my technical skills, but also cultivated valuable soft skills in a collaborative team environment.

Currently, I am looking for a dynamic and committed team environment to further enhance my expertise and contribute to the collective success of the company. My desire is to continue a continuous learning journey, collaborate with like-minded professionals and play an active role in advancing the company's goals and creating a thriving work environment.
